                    <h3>John F. Kennedy - We Choose to go to the Moon</h3>
                </a>
                <p>
                    We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
                    because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and
                    measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to
                    accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>

                </a>
                <p>The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk, 240,000 mniles away. It was hard to
                    think that that little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic
                    interests, famines, wars, pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward
                    stranger in a space-craft, coming from some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never
                    know that it was inhabited at all. But the samw wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively
                    that if the earth were inhabited, then the destinies of all who lived on it must inevitably be
                    interwoven and joined. We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around in space. From
                    out there it really is 'one world'.</p>

                    <h3>Buzz Aldrin - Magnificent Desolation</h3>
                </a>
                <p>I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline travel is today. I’m convinced,
                    however, that the true future of space travel does not lie with government agencies — NASA is still
                    obsessed with the idea that the primary purpose of the space program is science — but real progress
                    will come from private companies competing to provide the ultimate adventure ride, and NASA will
                    receive the trickle-down benefits.</p>
